PRAVA ESENCIA (r) C7 Luxury Face Oil 

Owner and Formulator Lisa Proctor, has invested her time and talents as a traveling, professional makeup artist, uncovering, utilizing and combining natural ingredients, inspired by women from around the world, including England, Ireland, The Slovak Republic, France, Africa, Russia, and Israel to form the best skin care product she has ever used. 

After suddenly discovering a life-threatening allergy to salicylates found in common foods, drinks, and even skin-care products, it became apparent that she could no longer tolerate certain commercial, medical grade beauty products that she had been using over the last decade. From this experience, Lisa started searching for a healthier skincare product and studying the natural ingredients used by women in the many places she visited. 

After her first medical mission trip to Africa in 2011, Lisa formulated and tested a simple yet effective beautiful new skincare product she later named "C7 Luxury Face Oil." This luxurious blend combines some of nature's most potent plant-derived ingredients, prized for their rarity and deep originative properties. Grounded in highly absorbent and nutrient rich oils of coconut, pomegranate, vetiver, frankincense, and myrrh, C7's ingredients have been hand-selected, PETA approved for Cruelty-free and Vegan Beauty Without Bunnies as well as Dermatologist tested and approved for a beauty that transcends time itself. Lisa insists on using only pure ingredients - many of which she discovered in her travels abroad. 

PRAVA ESENCIA (r) is more than a label. Translated from Slovak, but made in the USA, the
name means, "Right Essence" - a statement of handmade craftsmanship in limited production to
emphasize quality over quantity. This luxury oil has been created for complexions of all types,
becoming an ideal emulsion that wonderfully renews skin for a healthy appearance, and a
luminous glow. PRAVA ESENCIA (r), "C7 Luxury Face Oil," renews hope and confidence with
simplified skincare, offering its user a less complicated and more natural beauty routine.
